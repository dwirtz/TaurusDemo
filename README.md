# TaurusDemo

This is simple template for using Taurus with Jenkins integration. Just declare a pipeline jenkins job and point to the 
repository. 
For customized use you have to change the *perf_test.yml* or *JenkinsFile* file.

* perf_test.yml: Description for executing load test via Taurus (using JMeter).
* JenkinsFile: The pipeline description to integrate the Taurus file with Jenkins (Performance Plugin)
